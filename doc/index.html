<p>Slob is made of an utility MVC framework made of Backbone Models and Collections, and React components as Views, and a middleware to render them and send their data to the client as JS objects.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p><code>npm install slob</code></p>

<h2 id="previous-work">Previous work</h2>

<p>Slob is inspired by the Twitter enginnering blog article <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/05/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html">Improving performance on twitter.com</a> regarding the need to be able to render content both client-side and server-side, and the Airbnb Nerd blog article <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/weve-launched-our-first-nodejs-app-to-product/">Our First Node.js App: Backbone on the Client and Server</a> for ideas reagarding the implementation.</p>

<p>The Airbnb team realeased their <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/rendr">Rendr</a> librairy, but I wanted something much simpler, as I only needed to render the HTML content of some views and pass along the corresponding data to the client app.</p>

<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>

<p>This code is still in very early development, it requires lots of testing and is not appropriate for production applications.</p>
